# BatchRenamer
Renames multiple files by replacing specified characters with new characters. This can remove unwanted characters in multiple file names. The program detects file extensions so using the program to remove periods will not affect the file type.

Example usage:

Files: ```test.1.txt, test.2.md, attempt.77.vlc```
```
What character to remove? .
What to replace with? _
```
Result: ```test_1.txt, test_2.md, attempt_77.vlc```
