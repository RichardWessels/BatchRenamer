# BatchRenamer

Renames multiple files by replacing specified characters with new characters. This can remove unwanted characters in multiple file names. The program detects file extensions so using the program to remove periods will not affect the file type.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3
- Tkinter (usually bundled with Python)
- Ability to navigate terminal/Power Shell/Command Prompt (for brevity sake, I'll just say terminal from now on)

The program has both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a command-line interface (CLI).

Running the GUI:

- Open up your terminal and find the folder that contains the program files (BatchRenamer).
- Run the command `python3 gui.py`. If this doesn't work, try: `python gui.py`.

Don't forget to select one of the files.

Running the CLI:

- Open up your terminal and find the folder that contains the program files (BatchRenamer).
- Run the command `python3 batch_file_renamer.py`. If this doesn't work, try: `python batch_file_renamer.py`.

Use cases:

- If you have a file(s) that seperates words with periods instead of spaces.
- If there is a word you would like to remove from multiple files.
- And hopefully a bunch more.

I hope you find this program useful.
